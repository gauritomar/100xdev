Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own.
An express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are function that have access to the request object (req) and the
response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's requests-response cycle.

The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next().

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
1. Execute any code
2. Make changes to the request and the response objects
3. End the request-response cycle
4. Call the next middleware function in the stack


Error Handling Middlewares take 4 arguments (err, req, res, next)
