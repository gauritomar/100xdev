Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google for use in the Chrome browser.
Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting and enables the development of scalable
and high-performance network applications.

Bun is like Nodejs but whatever Nodejs does, Bun does better

Other than the face that JS is single threaded, 
Node.js is slow 
hence we rewrote the JS runtime for the backend and introduced Bun.
It is significantly faster runtime, it is written in Zig.

use cases of Nodejs

1. create CLIs
2. create a video player
3. create a game
4. create an HTTPs server (95% of use cases)
