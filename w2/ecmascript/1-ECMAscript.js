/*
ECMA script is the scripting language javascript has been written in. It is the documentation
that provides the javascript standards.
Whoever wants to make a javascript compiler needs to support these specifications laid out


ES5 
ES6
ES2015
ES2017

these are all ECMAScript Specifications and introduces new features and syntaxes

eg. - Internet Explorer supports an old version of ECMA specifications.
Promise was introduced around ES2017 so Internet Explorer might not be able to execute that

Javascript uses additional features that are not part of the ECMAScript specification like the DOM manipulation
which is for web dev but not defined by ECMA Script.

Date, var, const, let, function have all been defined by the ECMA Script
setTimeout, fs.readFile etc are all sync function handed over for the browser/ runtime environment to support
^ these are not defined by the ECMAScript, These are defined by web APIs
